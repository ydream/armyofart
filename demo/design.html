				<div class="description">
					<p>Since it's probably going to be stuck somewhere under your TV, it makes sense why Apple didn't change up the Apple TV's design much. It's still made of black plastic, but it's significantly taller than before, almost like two of the older Apple TVs stacked on top of each other. On the back, there's the obligatory HDMI port, along with Ethernet, USB-C and power ports. Unfortunately, you're out of luck if you're still relying on optical audio cables; the Apple TV relies entirely on HDMI for audio now. That shouldn't be a problem for most people, but if you've got a budget soundbar, or if you haven't upgraded your home theater in the past decade, be ready to pick up an HDMI/optical cable splitter.</p>
